# RNA-seq Count Data Analysis Workflow with DESeq2
Both basic and advanced workflow of RNA-seq count data analysis for the detection of differentially expressed genes is presented using the [DESeq2 package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) that provides methods for testing differential expression using negative binomial generalized linear models.
